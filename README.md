# Data_Analysis_Python
To wrap up my challanges with FreeCodeCamp - Data Analysis with Python 4 projects were uploaded\n
1. Demographic Data Analyzer which performs varies of calculations on data imported from adult.data.csv\n
2. Medical Examiner which created catplot with 2 barplots and one heatmap from medical_examination.csv\n
3. Time Series Visualization which creates 3 different plots: line, bar, box from fcc-forum-reviews.csv file\n
4. Sea level predictor which uses scipy formula to predict future sea-level and draw plot-line from epa-sea-level.csv file\n
